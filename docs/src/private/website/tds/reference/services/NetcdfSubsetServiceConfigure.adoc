= Configuring the NetCDF Subset Service

The Netcdf Subset Service (NCSS) is one of the ways that the TDS can
serve data. It is an experimental REST protocol for returning subsets of
CDM datasets. We want to eventually serve all
<<../../netcdf-java/CDM/index#,CDM>>-compatible datasets through
NCSS, but right now there are some link:#restrictions[restrictions] on
the types of datasets that are supported.

This documentation is for TDS administrators. If you are a client
wanting to access data through the Netcdf Subset Service, look at
<<NetcdfSubsetServiceReference#,NetCDF Subset Service Reference>>.

== Enabling the Netcdf Subset Service in the TDS

The netCDF Subset Service must be enabled in the `threddsConfig.xml`
configuration file before it can be used. This is done by adding an
*allow* element to the *NetcdfSubsetService* element as follows:

-----------------------
<NetcdfSubsetService>
    <allow>true</allow>
</NetcdfSubsetService>
-----------------------

Note: Details on other configuration options for NCSS are available in
the <<ThreddsConfigXMLFile#ncss,threddsConfig.xml>> docs.

== Serving Datasets with the Netcdf Subset Service

In your configuration catalogs, you must define the service like this is you're serving GRID data:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<service name="ncssGrid" serviceType="NetcdfSubset" base="/thredds/ncss/grid/" />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and like this if you're serving POINT data:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<service name="ncssPoint" serviceType="NetcdfSubset" base="/thredds/ncss/point/" />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, as usual, add the service to any datasets that you want served, e.g.:

------------------------------------------------------------------
<dataset name="datasetName" ID="datasetID" urlPath="/my/urlPath">
   <serviceName>ncssGrid</serviceName>
</dataset>
------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the name of the service ( _subsetServer_ in this example) is
arbitrary, but the *serviceType* and *base* must be exactly as shown.

== Restrictions on what files can be served

First, only datasets in the format that the CDM can read are supported.
Second, the data must represent one of the following
<<../../netcdf-java/reference/FeatureDatasets/Overview#,Feature
Types>>: GRID, POINT, STATION.

=== Verifying that a dataset is gridded

Open your file in the
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp[NetCDF
ToolsUI program], using the _*FeatureTypes->Grids*_ tab. Any fields
identified as grids will show up in the top table. To be sure, go into
the viewer (click image:images/redraw.gif[Redraw] to bring up the
Viewer, then click image:images/redraw.gif[Redraw] again to show the
data) and make sure the data is displayed correctly. If all that works,
then the data should be served correctly by the TDS.

=== Verifying that a dataset is ``pointed''

Open your file in the ToolsUI program using the
FeatureTypes->PointFeature tab. In the top table, verify that
``featureType'' is either ``POINT'' or ``STATION''.
