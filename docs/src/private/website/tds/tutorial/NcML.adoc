Aggregation]

An *NcML document* is an XML document that uses the
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/[NetCDF Markup
Language] to define a **CDM dataset**. NcML can be embedded directly
into the TDS catalogs to achieve a number of powerful features, shown
below. This embedded NcML is only useful in the TDS server catalogs, it
is not meaningful to a THREDDS client, and so is not included in the
client catalogs.

One can put an NcML element inside a `dataset` element, in which case it
is a self-contained NcML dataset, or inside a `datasetScan` element,
where it modifies a regular dataset. In both cases, we call the result a
**virtual dataset**, and **you cannot serve a virtual dataset with a
file-serving protocol like FTP or HTTP**. However, you can use
_subsetting services_ like OPeNDAP, WCS, WMS and NetcdfSubset.

== Using NcML in a `dataset` element

NcML embedded in a TDS `dataset` element creates a *self-contained NcML*
`dataset`. The TDS dataset does not refer to a data root, because the
NcML contains its own location. The TDS dataset must have a unique URL
path (this is true for all TDS datasets), but unlike a regular dataset,
does not have to match a data root.

=== Modifying an existing dataset

You can use use NcML to modify an existing CDM dataset:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0"
           xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
           name="TDS workshop test 1" version="1.0.2">
1)  <service name="ncdods" serviceType="OPENDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/"/>

2)  <dataset name="Example NcML Modified" ID="ExampleNcML-Modified" urlPath="ExampleNcML/Modified.nc">
      <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
3)    <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2"
              location="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/example1.nc">
4)      <variable name="Temperature" orgName="T"/>
5)      <variable name="ReletiveHumidity" orgName="rh">
6)        <attribute name="long_name" value="relatively humid"/>
           <attribute name="units" value="percent (%)"/>
7)        <remove type="attribute" name="description"/>
         </variable >
       </netcdf>
    </dataset>
  </catalog>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== For more information

See https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/Tutorial.html[NcML
Tutorial] for more details.

==== Notes:

1.  A `service` is defined that allows the virtual dataset to be served
through **OPENDAP**. Make sure that the `base` attribute is exactly as
shown.
2.  The virtual dataset is created and given a `urlPath` of
`ExampleNcML/Modified.nc`. The `urlPath` is essentially arbitrary, but
must be unique within the TDS, and you should maintain a consistent
naming convention to ensure uniqueness, especially for large collections
of data. Its important to also give the dataset a unique `ID`.
3.  An NcML dataset is defined which references the netCDF file at the
absolute location `/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/example1.nc`. Note that
you must declare the NcML namespace exactly as shown.
4.  The variable named `T` in the original file is renamed Temperature.
5.  The variable named `rh` in the original file is renamed
RelativeHumidity.
6.  Two attributes of `rh` are defined, `long_name` and `units`. If
these already exist, they are replaced.
7.  The attribute of `rh` called `description` is removed.

=== Dataset vs virtual dataset

Lets look at serving a file directly vs serving it through NcML:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0"
           xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
           name="TDS workshop test 2" version="1.0.2">

    <service name="ncdods" serviceType="OPENDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/"/>
1) <datasetRoot path="test/ExampleNcML" location="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/" />
2) <dataset name="Example Dataset" ID="Example" urlPath="test/ExampleNcML/example1.nc">
      <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
    </dataset>
3)  <dataset name="Example NcML Modified" ID="Modified" urlPath="ExampleNcML/Modified.nc">
      <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
4)    <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2"
              location="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/example1.nc">
          <variable name="Temperature" orgName="T"/>
      </netcdf>
    </dataset>
  </catalog>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Notes:

1.  A `datasetRoot` is defined that associates URL path
`test/ExampleNcML` with the disk location `/data/nc/.`
2.  The `dataset` is created with a `urlPath` of
`test/ExampleNcML/example.nc`. The first part of the path is matched to
the `datasetRoot`, so that the full `dataset` location is
`/data/nc/example1.nc. `This file is served directly by this `dataset`
element.
3.  The same file is used in a virtual `dataset` defined by the embedded
NcML. The virtual `dataset` is given an (arbitrary) `urlPath` of
`ExampleNcML/Modified.nc`.
4.  The NcML element is defined which references the netCDF file at the
absolute location `/data/nc/example1.nc`. The only modification is to
rename the variable `T` to `Temperature`.

=== Using NcML aggregation

Here is an example that defines a dataset using NcML aggregation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0"
           xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
           name="TDS workshop test 3" version="1.0.2">

1)  <service name="ncdods" serviceType="OPENDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/" />
2)  <dataset name="Example NcML Agg" ID="ExampleNcML-Agg" urlPath="ExampleNcML/Agg.nc">
3)    <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
4)    <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
5)      <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting">
6)        <scan location="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/cg/" dateFormatMark="CG#yyyyDDD_HHmmss"
                suffix=".nc" subdirs="false"/>
        </aggregation>
      </netcdf>
    </dataset>
  </catalog>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== For more information

See
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/Aggregation.html[NcML
Aggregation] for more details.

==== Notes:

1.  An OPENDAP `service` is defined called `ncdods`.
2.  A THREDDS `dataset` is defined, which must have a `urlPath` that is
unique within the TDS, in this case `ExampleNcML/Agg.nc`.
3.  The dataset uses the `ncdods` service.
4.  An NcML `netcdf` element is embedded inside the THREDDS dataset
element.
5.  An NcML `aggregation` of type `joinExisting` is declared, using the
existing time dimension as the aggregation dimension.
6.  All the files in the directory `/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/cg/` that
end with `.nc` will be scanned to create the aggregation. A
dateFormatMark is used to define the time coordinates, indicating there
is exactly one time coordinate in each file.

== Using NcML in a `datasetScan` element

If an NcML element is added to a `DatasetScan`, it will modify all of
the datasets contained within the DatasetScan. It is not self-contained,
however, since it gets its location from the datasets that are
dynamically scanned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)  <datasetScan name="Ocean Satellite Data" ID="ocean/sat" path="ocean/sat" location="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/ocean/">
      <filter>
        <include wildcard="*.nc" />
      </filter>
2)    <metadata inherited="true">
         <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
         <dataType>Grid</dataType>
      </metadata>
3)    <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
         <attribute name="Conventions" value="CF-1.0"/>
      </netcdf>
     </datasetScan>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Notes:

1.  A `datasetScan` element is created whose contained datasets start
with URL path `ocean/sat`, and whose contents are all the files in the
directory */machine/tds/workshop/ncml/ocean`/`* which end in `.nc`.
2.  All contained datasets _inherit_ metadata indicating they use the
`ncdods` service and are of type `Grid`.
3.  All contained datasets are _wrapped_ by this NcML element. In this
case, each dataset has the global attribute `Conventions="CF-1.0"` added
to it. Note that there is no `location` attribute, which is implicitly
supplied by the datasets found by the`datasetScan`.

=== DatasetScan versus Aggregation Scan

The `scan` element in the NcML aggregation is similar in purpose to the
`datasetScan` element, but be careful not to confuse the two. The
`datasetScan` element is more powerful, and has more options for
filtering etc. Its job is to create nested `dataset` elements inside the
datasetScan, and so has various options to add information to those
nested datasets. It has a generalized framework (CrawlableDataset) for
crawling other things besides file directories. The `scan` elementâ€™s job
is to easily specify what files go into an NcML aggregation, and those
individual files are hidden inside the aggregation dataset. It can only
scan file directories. In the future, some of the capabilities of
`datasetScan` will migrate into NcML `scan`.

=== Exercise: DatasetScan versus Aggregation Scan

Lets look at using a DatasetScan and an Aggregation scan on the same
collection of files. Download `catalogScan.xml`, place it in your TDS
`${tomcat_home}/content/thredds` directory and add a `catalogRef` to it
from your main catalog.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0"
     xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
     name="TDS workshop test 4" version="1.0.2">

   <service name="ncdods" serviceType="OPENDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/"/>
1) <dataset name="Example NcML Agg" ID="ExampleNcML-Agg" urlPath="ExampleNcML/Agg.nc">
     <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
2)   <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
       <aggregation dimName="time" type="joinExisting" recheckEvery="4 sec">
         <scan location="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/cg/" dateFormatMark="CG#yyyyDDD_HHmmss" suffix=".nc" subdirs="false"/>
       </aggregation>
     </netcdf>
   </dataset>

3) <datasetScan name="CG Data" ID="cg/files" path="cg/files" location="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/cg/">
     <metadata inherited="true">
       <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
       <dataType>Grid</dataType>
     </metadata>
     <filter>
4)     <include wildcard="*.nc"/>
     </filter>
5)   <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
       <attribute name="Yoyo" value="Ma"/>
     </netcdf>
   </datasetScan>

</catalog>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  A virtual dataset is defined with URL `ExampleNcML/Agg.nc`
2.  The NcML aggregation for this dataset. Remember that the
`recheckEvery` attribute only applies when using a scan element.
3.  A `datasetScan` element is created whose contained datasets start
with URL path `cg/files`, and which scans the directory
`/workshop/test/cg/`
4.  Only files which end in `.nc`.
5.  Add a global attribute to each file in the collection.

Start and restart your TDS and look at those datasets through the HTML
interface and through ToolsUI.

== Using NcML in a `featureCollection` element

Here we show a brief example of modifying files with NcML in a
`featureCollection` element.

Download `catalogFmrcNcml.xml`, place it in the
`${tomcat_home}/content/thredds` directory and add a `catalogRef` to it
from your main catalog:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0"
   xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="Unidata THREDDS Data Server" version="1.0.3">

 <service name="ncdods" serviceType="OPENDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/"/>

 <featureCollection featureType="FMRC" name="GOMOOS" harvest="true" path="fmrc/USGS/GOMOOS">
   <metadata inherited="true">
   <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
   <dataFormat>netCDF</dataFormat>
   <documentation type="summary">Munge this with NcML</documentation>
   </metadata>

   <collection spec="/machine/tds/workshop/ncml/gomoos/gomoos.#yyyyMMdd#.cdf$"/>
   <protoDataset>
1)   <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
       <attribute name="History" value="Processed by Kraft"/>
     </netcdf>
   </protoDataset>

2) <netcdf xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/netcdf/ncml-2.2">
    <variable name="time">
      <attribute name="units" value="days since 2006-11-01 00:00 UTC"/>
    </variable>
    <attribute name="Conventions" value="CF-1.0"/>
   </netcdf>

  </featureCollection>
</catalog>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Notes:

1.  The `protoDataset` is modified by adding a global attribute
`History="Processed by Kraft"`.
2.  _Each_ component file is changed by modifying the time variableâ€™s
units attribute and adding a global attribute `Conventions="CF-1.0"`

You might wonder why not put the global attribute `Conventions="CF-1.0"`
on the protoDataset instead of on each individual dataset? The reason is
because in an FMRC, each dataset is converted into a GridDataset, and
then combined into the FMRC. So the modifications in 2) are whats needed
to make the individual datasets be correctly interpreted as a Grid
dataset. The modifications to the `protoDataset` are then applied to the
resulting FMRC 2D dataset.

== Debugging NcML

When things go wrong, its best to first debug the aggregation outside of
the TDS:

1.  Go to the TDS catalog and find the problem dataset. Inside the
`<dataset>` element will be a `<netcdf>` element, that is the NcML
aggregation. Extract it out and put it in a file called "`test.ncml`".
.. 1.  Add the XML header to the top of it:
`<?xml version="1.0"encoding="UTF-8"?>`
.. 2.  Remove the `recheckEvery` attribute if present on the `<scan>`
element.
.. 3.  Make sure that the `<scan>` location is available on the machine you
are running ToolsUI
+
Now start up
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/webstart/netCDFtools.jnlp[ToolsUI],
and in the viewer tab, navigate to `test.ncml` and try to open it.
2.  If the dataset is
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/Aggregation.html#dynamic[dynamic]
(files can be added or deleted), add the `recheckEvery` attribute on the
`scan` element and open the dataset, then reopen after a new file has
arrived (and `recheckEvery` time has passed). Generally you make
`recheckEvery` very short while testing.
3.  Now add the NcML dataset back to the TDS, without a `recheckEvery`
attribute on the `scan` element. See if OPeNDAP access works.
4.  Add the `recheckEvery` attribute (if needed) and test again.

=== Canâ€™t use HTTPServer

Remember that you canâ€™t use *HTTPServer* for NcML datasets. Use only the
_subsetting services_ **OpenDAP**, *WCS, WMS,* and *NetcdfSubset.*
