## What Is The THREDDS Data Server?

The THREDDS Data Server (TDS) is a component of the Unidata's [Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS)](https://journals.tdl.org/jodi/index.php/jodi/article/view/51){:target="_blank"} project.
The goal of the THREDDS project is to provide students, educators, and researchers with coherent access to a large collection of real-time and archived datasets from a variety of environmental data sources at a number of distributed TDS server sites.

The TDS is an open-source Java web application contained in a single [WAR](https://fileinfo.com/extension/war){:target="_blank"} file which allows easy installation in a servlet container such as the [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} application server.
